            "* **Awarding degrees:**  Universities grant both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.\n",
            "* **Multiple disciplines:**  They cover a range of academic subjects, not just vocational training.\n",
            "* **Research focus:**  In addition to teaching, universities are centers of research.\n",
            "* **Academic freedom:**  A core principle is the right to unhindered pursuit of knowledge and open exchange of ideas.\n",
            "* **Historical roots:** The first universities in Europe were established by Catholic monks, with the University of Bologna (1088) recognized as the first in the modern sense.  It used the word *universitas* (meaning \"community of teachers and scholars\") and offered secular degrees alongside religious ones.  Earlier institutions of learning existed, but Bologna marked a significant step toward the modern university model.  The concept of academic freedom originated there as well.\n",
            "* **Evolution:**  The modern definition emphasizes the educational and research functions rather than the original corporate structure.  While historically associated with Europe, universities now exist globally.\n",
            "* **Structure:**  Modern universities can be complex institutions, potentially encompassing multiple colleges or campuses, as exemplified by Anna University.  They might also affiliate with other colleges, expanding their reach and influence.  Anna University's history illustrates how university structures can evolve over time through mergers and splits.\n",

            "* **University of al-Qarawiyyin:** Founded in 859 CE as a mosque, its status as a university is debated among scholars, with some considering its modern reorganization in 1963 as the point of transition.\n",
